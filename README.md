- Developed ML (Random Forest, Ridge Regression, XGBoost) and DL (MLP Neural Network)
models to predict stock price fluctuations (using historical stock price data).
- Processed and engineered new features from time-series stock data, including target variables
(price fluctuation), lagged price features, and rolling averages.
- Applied feature selection (f-regression, mutual information) to identify key predictors.
- Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, and manual tuning.
- Evaluated model performance with MAE, MSE, and RMSE for accurate predictions.
